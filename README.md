# exercism_python

Exercism is a cool tool that gives a lot of beginner problems to attempt using python.
From the command line a challenge can be generated and a subsequent solution can then be tested before persuing with the next.
Python is one of the tools that may be applied by analyst at my company in order to help with smaller tasks such as formatting data.
